# Cloud-row validation runbooks

The two Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 rows are validated on a cloud VM the
operator starts themselves. Unlike the Jetson and the MacBook, the
machine is disposable and billed by the minute, which shapes this
procedure: everything that can refuse a run refuses it *before* the
first install, and the harness restores nothing when it finishes.

`tools/validation/ubuntu-l4-cloud-lifecycle.sh` **provisions nothing**.
It does not create, start, resize or delete any cloud resource, and it
carries no project, zone or account identifier. Starting and stopping
the VM is a separate, deliberate act.

## What a run produces

One `lifecycle-report.json` per row, valid against
`config/schemas/lifecycle_report.json`, written to the evidence
directory along with the stage logs it cites and an
`artifact-digest.txt` naming the artifact set that was installed.

**A run today reports `incomplete`, and the release gate refuses the
row.** That is the accurate state rather than a defect:

| Canonical stage | Cloud rows |
| --- | --- |
| install | covered |
| upgrade | **skipped** — no published amd64 predecessor |
| deploy-smoke | covered |
| status-logs | covered |
| rollback | **skipped** — no published amd64 predecessor |
| restart | covered |
| crash-loop | **skipped** — separate change |
| offline | **skipped** — separate change |

No released tag carries an amd64 runtime package set: `v0.1.x` published
only the CLI for that architecture. So on these rows there is nothing to
upgrade *from* and nothing to roll back *to* until a release ships one,
at which point the next release can be validated against it. The harness
records that as the skip reason rather than building a local baseline
and calling the result an upgrade.

## What a passing run does and does not prove

It proves the candidate installs through the shipped installer on this
OS, that the services come up, that doctor's `platform_row` resolves
this row **by live detection** with nothing failing, that the control
plane admits a bundle and runs a worker for it, that an inference
request round-trips through that worker, that `tensorplate status`
answers and still reports the deployment, that the journal carries the
services' output, and that both services restart with the deployment
re-warmed from durable state.

Three things it records rather than asserts, because asserting them
would claim more than the run establishes:

- **Worker supervision.** The shipped amd64 agent config declares no
  supervision block, so the run records `not_configured` rather than a
  healthy supervisor. On these rows that check is a statement about the
  configuration, not about a supervisor being exercised.
- **`tensorplate logs`.** The packaged `cli.json` points `log_source` at
  `/var/log/tensorplate/tensorplate-agent.log`, and nothing in the
  product writes that file on a Linux package install — both services
  log to the journal. The command is expected to fail, its exit status
  is filed as `logs-command.exit`, and the stage requires the journal
  capture instead. This is a product gap the run surfaces, not a
  validation failure.
- **The accelerator.** See below.

It does **not** prove the accelerator computed anything. The
deploy-smoke bundle selects the device-neutral `fixture` backend
profile, because there is no CUDA fixture backend to select yet. The
run exercises admission, the worker launch and the inference path
against the real installed appliance; it executes no CUDA kernel. Do not
describe a run of this harness as GPU validation.

## Prerequisites

1. **A running VM** with an NVIDIA accelerator matching the row, running
   Ubuntu 24.04 on x86_64, reachable over SSH, with an operator account
   that has sudo. The harness refuses every other host.

2. **The NVIDIA driver installed**, such that
   `/proc/driver/nvidia/version` is readable. The installer treats a
   missing driver as advisory; this harness treats it as fatal, because
   a run that cannot see the accelerator cannot produce evidence for a
   row whose whole subject is that accelerator.

3. **An operator account that can reach the agent's control socket.**
   The harness refuses to run as root, so every CLI call is made as the
   operator. The agent creates `/run/tensorplate/agent.sock` owned by
   the `tensorplate` group with group-only access, so add the operator
   to that group after installing and start a new session:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG tensorplate "$USER"
   ```

   Without it the install stage fails on doctor's `agent_reachable`
   finding, which is the correct outcome but an expensive way to learn
   about a group membership.

4. **PyTorch importable by the descriptor's interpreter** — by default
   `/usr/bin/python3`, pinned in the backend descriptor's
   `python.interpreter` field. This is a prerequisite rather than a step
   the harness performs, because the installer runs `tensorplate doctor`
   at the end of a runtime install and refuses a critical finding;
   `python_pytorch_runtime` is probed unconditionally on Linux.

   Ubuntu 24.04 marks its system interpreter externally-managed
   (PEP 668), so the command from
   [`python-pytorch-backend.md`](../install/python-pytorch-backend.md)
   needs one of:

   ```bash
   # On a disposable validation VM, installing into the system
   # interpreter is acceptable and keeps the descriptor's default path.
   sudo /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages torch
   ```

   or a virtualenv with `TP_PYTHON_PYTORCH_EXECUTABLE` pointed at it.
   Unlike the CPU-only CI smoke, do **not** use the CPU wheel index
   here: this row has an accelerator, and the default index resolves to
   the CUDA build.

   This step is unproven on Ubuntu 24.04 — nothing in this repository
   has run it there — and it is the likeliest cause of a failed first
   run. Verify `python3 -c 'import torch'` before starting.

5. **A verified candidate artifact set** copied onto the VM: `install.sh`,
   the artifact manifest, `SHA256SUMS`, and the amd64 `.deb` packages.
   The harness re-verifies the set against `SHA256SUMS` before it
   installs anything, and hashes that file as the run's artifact digest.

## Running it

```bash
tools/validation/ubuntu-l4-cloud-lifecycle.sh \
  --assets-dir <candidate artifacts> \
  --tested-version <bare X.Y.Z> \
  --evidence-dir <new or empty dir> \
  --confirm RESET-TENSORPLATE
```

`--tested-version` is the bare release version the evidence authorizes —
`0.2.1`, never `0.2.1-rc.1` or `0.2.1~rc.1`, even when the artifacts
under test came from a candidate. The harness refuses the candidate
spellings rather than accepting them.

Add `--allow-unsigned` for a candidate build with no published
signature, and say so in the pull request: the digest then identifies an
artifact set nobody outside that machine can resolve.

Check eligibility without touching the host first — this installs
nothing, writes nothing, and is worth doing before the VM has been
running long:

```bash
tools/validation/ubuntu-l4-cloud-lifecycle.sh \
  --assets-dir <candidate artifacts> \
  --tested-version <bare X.Y.Z> \
  --evidence-dir <new or empty dir> \
  --preflight-only --confirm RESET-TENSORPLATE
```

The harness purges TensorPlate packages and state before installing and
**does not restore them**, which is why it demands the confirmation
token. Run it on a VM you are willing to delete.

## Filing the evidence

File the report and its stage logs under
`docs/validation/evidence/<version>/<row_id>/`. **Sanitize first** — see
that directory's README. The captures from this row carry more host
detail than the other two: `journalctl` output names the instance, and
doctor and status carry cloud instance metadata. Every raw capture is
written to a named side file for exactly that reason.

Delete the VM when the run is done.

## What a failed run is worth

The same as everywhere else: the report names the stage, attaches its
log, and that is what a fix is written against. Re-run after fixing
rather than editing the report. Re-running into the same evidence
directory is refused; the harness requires a new or empty one, so a
retry cannot inherit a previous attempt's stage logs or digest.
